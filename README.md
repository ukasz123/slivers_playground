# slivers_playground

A Flutter tools project for visual debugging of different slivers.

## Getting Started

Use [SliverDiagnostic](https://github.com/ukasz123/slivers_playground/blob/master/lib/sliver_diagnostic.dart)
to wrap another sliver and receive some diagnostic information about
constraint and geometry of child sliver.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
